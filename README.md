R based application to create a clean dataset from raw data regarding federal contract opportunities obtained from the federal government website SAM.gov.
Initial software version only has the API calls functioning to retrieve raw data from SAM.gov, a government website that publishes contract opportunities for interested federal contractors.
The R code clean and processes the data into usable clean data sets that will be the source to train a future machine learning algorithm.  The output from the source code is a series of dataset saved in excel format.
